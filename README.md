# Unified AI + Cyber + Business Automation System (Vanilla JS)

Flagship portfolio project: A single-page app unifying three modules for AI-driven automation. Demonstrates cybersecurity monitoring, business ops management, and lead outreach with real triggers and charts.

Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS + Chart.js for charts. Deploys statically on GitHub Pages.

## Features
- **Modules**:
  - **Cybersecurity Monitor**: Auto-threat detection (interval-triggered), logs, alerts, trend charts.
  - **Business Ops Manager**: Task submission with auto-routing/prioritization, dashboard, efficiency charts.
  - **Lead & Outreach System**: Message processing for lead extraction, auto-outreach simulation, conversion charts.
- **Charts**: Interactive line/bar charts via Chart.js.
- **Automation Triggers**: Periodic scans, event-based routing/outreach, high-threat alerts.
- **UI/UX**: Tabs for modules, dark mode, persistence (localStorage), CSV export, responsive.
- **Simulated API**: Client-side logic mimics API routes; extensible to real backends.

Showcases for employers:
✔ "API" logic (simulated routes)
✔ Frontend mastery
✔ Automation workflows
✔ Cyber + Ops + Leads integration
✔ System design thinking
✔ Executable real app
